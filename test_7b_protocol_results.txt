To find classes in your codebase that implement a protocol, you can use the `grep` command to search for the protocol name in the codebase. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the terminal in PyCharm.
2. Run the following command to search for classes that implement a specific protocol, for example, `MyProtocol`:

```sh
grep -r "implements MyProtocol" .
```

This command will search recursively through the current directory (`.`) for lines containing the string "implements MyProtocol".

If you want to be more specific and only find classes that implement a protocol, you can use a regular expression to match class definitions that include the protocol name. For example:

```sh
grep -r "class [^ ]* implements MyProtocol" .
```

This command will search for lines that match the pattern "class [^ ]* implements MyProtocol", which will help you identify classes that implement the `MyProtocol`.

If you need to find protocols themselves, you can search for the protocol definition:

```sh
grep -r "interface MyProtocol" .
```

This command will search for lines containing the string "interface MyProtocol", which will help you identify protocol definitions.

If you find any matches, you can review the code to understand how the classes and protocols are implemented.<|im_end|>
