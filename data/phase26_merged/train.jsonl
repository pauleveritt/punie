One way to approach this is by using extractive summarization techniques, which involve selecting the most important sentences or phrases from the original text and combining them to form a summary. \nPython libraries such as NLTK and Gensim provide tools for text summarization. For example, the NLTK library includes the TextRank summarization algorithm, which is based on the PageRank algorithm used by Google to rank web pages. Gensim also includes several summarization algorithms, such as the LexRank and LSA algorithms.\nTo apply these algorithms to the given statement, we could first tokenize the text into sentences using NLTK or Gensim. Then, we could apply the summarization algorithm to select the most important sentences or phrases from the original text. The resulting summary would be a more concise version of the statement while preserving its meaning. \nFor example, using the TextRank algorithm from NLTK, the summarized version of the statement could be: \"The team's intensive preparation did not prevent an overwhelming loss in the game.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure!

Here's an example of a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n```\ndef factorial(n):\n if n == 0:\n return 1\n else:\n return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\nThis function defines the base case when `n` equals zero, and recursively calls itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches the base case.
